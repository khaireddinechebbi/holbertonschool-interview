This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to setting up and using Metasploit . It covers installation, basic usage, payload creation, exploration of auxiliary modules, and documentation of findings.

Please use the notes and loot commands starting from Part 2. Dump the data and upload it along with the script for all tasks.

Use this command loot -t csv

Part 1: Setup Metasploit Locally with PostgreSQL

Set up Metasploit with PostgreSQL to manage data efficiently.

Install PostgreSQL: Install PostgreSQL and its dependencies on your Ubuntu system.

Start PostgreSQL Service: Start the PostgreSQL service to ensure the database is operational.

Create PostgreSQL User: Create a dedicated PostgreSQL user specifically for Metasploit.

Create PostgreSQL Database: Set up a PostgreSQL database that Metasploit will use to store its data.

Initialize Metasploit Database: Initialize the Metasploit database to prepare it for use.

Verify Database Connection: Start the Metasploit console and verify the connection to the PostgreSQL database.

Part 2: Basic Usage of Metasploit

Familiarize yourself with basic commands in Metasploit for exploiting vulnerabilities.

Start the Metasploit Console: Access the Metasploit console to begin interacting with its features.

Search for Exploits: Learn how to search for available exploits within Metasploit’s extensive database.

Select an Exploit: Choose a specific exploit from the search results to prepare for exploitation.

Set Exploit Options: Configure the necessary options for the selected exploit before execution.

Set Payload: Define the payload that will be delivered to the target system during exploitation.

Set Local Host and Port: Specify the local host and port where Metasploit will listen for incoming connections.

Run the Exploit: Execute the configured exploit to attempt exploitation on the target system.

Part 3: Create and Use a Simple Payload

Understand how to create and deploy a payload using Metasploit.

Generate a Payload: Use Metasploit’s msfvenom tool to create a custom payload with specific characteristics.

Payload Specifications: Specify parameters such as payload type, local host, local port, output format, and output file name. payload.elf

Execute the Payload: Validate the generated payload and understand how it can be executed on Ubuntu systems.

Part 4: Explore Auxiliary Modules

Learn about auxiliary modules in Metasploit for performing additional tasks during penetration testing.

Start the Metasploit Console: Access the Metasploit console to begin exploring auxiliary modules.

Search for Auxiliary Modules: Discover and explore available auxiliary modules designed for various tasks.

Select an Auxiliary Module: Choose a specific auxiliary module, such as auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp, for scanning purposes.

Configure Module Options: Set the required options for the selected auxiliary module, such as specifying the target hosts (RHOSTS).

Execute the Module: Run the configured auxiliary module to perform its designated task, such as conducting a TCP port scan.

Part 5: Documentation and Reporting

Learn how to document findings and generate reports from Metasploit sessions.

Documentation of Activities: Document all actions performed during Metasploit sessions, including commands executed and their respective outputs.

Using the Notes Command: Utilize Metasploit’s notes command to store detailed findings and notes during penetration testing activities.

Using the Loot Command: Employ Metasploit’s loot command to collect and store valuable data obtained during penetration testing sessions.

Generate Reports: Compile documented findings and collected data into comprehensive reports that summarize the activities, findings, and recommendations from the penetration testing exercise.
